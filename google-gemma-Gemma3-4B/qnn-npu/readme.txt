ML Demo Notebook Examples - Gemma3-4B model
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This package includes Jupyter Notebook examples, code, documentation and assets
to optimize the Gemma3-4B machine learning (ML) models.

Please go to each of the following notebook folders in sequence and
follow the instructions in the ReadMe.md therein:

- Quantization
	- PyTorch Model optimization and export using AIMET
- Conversion
	- Preparation and conversion of ONNX model to Qualcomm NN format
- genai
	- Generate final artifacts for onnxruntime-genai based inferencing

Quantization and Conversion to be performed on Linux machine (refer to Platform requirements in ReadMe.md therein)
Genai to be performed on Windows Device with Qualcomm NPU

These notebooks are considered “Evaluation Technology” as set forth in the PKLA
Product Kit License Agreement with QTIL.
